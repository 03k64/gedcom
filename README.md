# GEDCOM

`gedcom` is a simple application that takes a directory containing one or more 
GEDCOM files as input and outputs one more corresponding JSON files to the same
directory containing data compatible with the FindMyPast relation API.

## Pre-Requisites

In order to run `gedcom` you will need to install Rust, the easiest way is to go
to [the rustup site](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions for your
operating system. This project currently requires a nightly version of Rust to 
be installed in order to use the 
[DrainFilter iterator API](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43244), you 
should therefore also run `rustup toolchain install nightly`. Once you have 
installed Rust (and the nightly toolchain) you will also need to install
[`grcov`](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) in order to generate a test coverage
report. You can do this by running `cargo install grcov`.

## Compiling and Running the Application

Rust is a compiled language, accordingly you must first compile `gedcom` before
using it. To compile a development build of `gedcom` you can use the command
`cargo build`, to compile an optimised build for benchmarking you should instead
run `cargo build --release`.

You can then run the compiled binary in one of two ways, either way you need to
provide an argument using the `-d` flag. The `-d` flag expects an argument
consisting of the path to a directory containing GEDCOM input files. The `-d`
flag also specifies the path to write the JSON output files which will be named
identically to the corresponding input file but with a `.json` extension.

### Option 1

You can run the binary using `cargo` in development mode using
`cargo run -- -d <path/to/gedcom/directory` or in release mode using
`cargo run --release -- -d <path/to/gedcom/directory>`.

### Option 2

You can run the development binary directly using
`target/debug/gedcom -d <path/to/gedcom/directory>` or the release binary
directly using `target/release/gedcom -d <path/to/gedcom/directory>`.

For the purposes of benchmarking, the release binary should be first compiled 
and then run using Option 2 above to avoid any overhead incurred by running 
through `cargo`.

## Running the Unit Tests and Generating a Coverage Report

Tests live alongside the code in [most](#things-to-improve) source files. They 
can be found at the end of the source code in a separate `tests` module. The 
`tests` module is preceded by a `#[cfg(test)]` directive that ensures these 
modules are _not_ compiled into optimised release builds.

The tests themselves may be run using `cargo test`. A coverage report may be
generated by running the `generate-coverage-report.sh` script. This script uses
`cargo clean` to first remove _all previously compiled binaries_. This step is
necessary to re-compile the development binary with specific options needed to
allow for coverage generation to be completed. You _will_ need to re-compile any
release builds before running benchmarks as outlined above.

## Running the Micro-Benchmarks

The [Criterion library](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html)
was used in development to ensure performance regressions did not occur. To this
end a small benchmark can be found in `benches/small_benchmark.rs`. Criterion
acts as a test harness, but also produces output in the below format that
allows regressions to be tracked between changes with a degree of statistical
significance.

### Example Micro-Benchmark Output

An initial benchmark run may produce output similar to the folllowing:

```shell
gedcom_to_relation_json ONE_NODE                                                                            
                        time:   [119.79 us 120.22 us 120.72 us]
Found 5 outliers among 100 measurements (5.00%)
  5 (5.00%) high mild

gedcom_to_relation_json THREE_NODE                                                                            
                        time:   [237.35 us 238.28 us 239.43 us]
Found 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)
  3 (3.00%) high mild

gedcom_to_relation_json SIBLING                                                                            
                        time:   [282.29 us 282.95 us 283.68 us]
Found 15 outliers among 100 measurements (15.00%)
  11 (11.00%) high mild
  4 (4.00%) high severe
```

A subsequent benchmark run (in this case following the marking of a function as
inline-able to the compiler) may produce output similar to the following:

```shell
gedcom_to_relation_json ONE_NODE                                                                            
                        time:   [103.02 us 103.26 us 103.51 us]
                        change: [-16.984% -16.013% -15.082%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has improved.
Found 11 outliers among 100 measurements (11.00%)
  7 (7.00%) high mild
  4 (4.00%) high severe

gedcom_to_relation_json THREE_NODE                                                                            
                        time:   [201.16 us 201.52 us 201.90 us]
                        change: [-18.292% -17.407% -16.474%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has improved.
Found 7 outliers among 100 measurements (7.00%)
  1 (1.00%) high mild
  6 (6.00%) high severe

gedcom_to_relation_json SIBLING                                                                            
                        time:   [243.63 us 244.05 us 244.52 us]
                        change: [-15.348% -14.551% -13.796%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has improved.

In addition to the command-line output provided as an overview, a HTML report is
generated automatically by Criterion and can be view by going to
`file:///</path/to/project/root>/target/criterion/report/index.html` in your
browser of choice.

The examples above were run on an Early 2015 Macbook Pro with an 2.9GHz Intel i5
CPU, 8GB 1867MHz DDR3 RAM and macOS v10.15.4. Your results may vary dependent on
machine specification.

## Project Structure

The project is split into two parts, or in Rust parlance, crates. The
application crate, consisting only of the file `src/main.rs`, handles execution
of the program. The library crate consisting of all other files in the `src`
directory, with an entrypoint in `src/lib.rs` provides all underlying GEDCOM
specific functionality. The library crate is in turn largely organised into two
submodules, `models` and `parser`.

### Dependencies and their Uses

Here is a brief overview of the third-party crates used in this library. These
crates are declared in the manifest file `Cargo.toml` under the `[dependencies]`
section.

## Things to Improve

The obvious thing to improve would be to round out test coverage, especially in
the `models` module and its submodules. The current `Birth` type would ideally
become a more generic `Fact` type. Given the scope of this challenge there did
not seem to be any gain for making this change. It would be nice to round out
the `relations` module against the existing relation API schema in order to test
against larger GEDCOM files.

Beyond this I would like to explore methods to introduce more concurrency, Rust
provides excellent support for concurrency and the
[rayon library](https://docs.rs/rayon/1.3.0/rayon/) provides very ergonomic
iterator support. I did investigate adding a parallel iterator over the files in
the directory, however this seemed to degrade performance when using smaller
GEDCOM files. I suspect it may improve things if larger files were to be used.
There are likely other places that could be converted to use parallel iterators
also.
